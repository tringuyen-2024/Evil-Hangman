# Evil Hangman

Introductory Java project for learning about data structures like sets and maps. The user chooses how many turns a game is allowed to last and how long of a word to guess. The program gives the illusion that it has chosen a word, but it actually hasn't! The program has a dictionary it starts with that it whittles down based on the user's input. When the user inputs a letter to guess, the program creates multiple subsets of words that contain that letter and that don't contain that letter. It then chooses from among those subsets as the new dictionary, selecting the biggest subset (usually the set without the user's letter). When the game ends, the program chooses the first word from the current dictionary as the word the user was "guessing". Because of this, it's very difficult for the user to win a game unless the user is allowed several turns.
